Participants in the Advanced Workshop: Eat, Sleep, Pitch/Design/Code/Sales Repeat will learn a range of advanced skills and strategies across four key areas:

Pitching:

Crafting compelling narratives to effectively communicate ideas and concepts.
Understanding the audience and tailoring pitches to resonate with their needs and interests.
Developing elevator pitches and mastering techniques for longer presentations.
Receiving constructive feedback and iteratively refining pitches for maximum impact.

Design:

Applying advanced design principles such as user-centered design and design thinking methodologies.
Utilizing prototyping tools and techniques to create interactive and visually appealing prototypes.
Iterating designs based on feedback and testing to enhance user experience and functionality.
Collaborating effectively within teams to ideate, design, and iterate product designs.

Coding:

Understanding advanced coding concepts such as software architecture, design patterns, and version control systems.
Implementing best practices in coding, including testing and debugging strategies.
Collaborating efficiently within coding teams using version control systems like Git.
Solving coding challenges and applying learned concepts to real-world scenarios.

Sales:

Mastering sales techniques, including consultative selling and overcoming objections.
Developing negotiation strategies to secure favorable outcomes for both parties.
Enhancing communication skills to effectively convey value propositions and handle customer objections.
Practicing sales scenarios through role-playing exercises to refine selling skills.
Throughout the workshop, participants will engage in interactive sessions, hands-on activities, and group exercises to apply their learning in practical contexts. They will receive guidance from experienced facilitators and have the opportunity to collaborate with peers, share insights, and receive feedback to enhance their skills further. By the end of the workshop, participants will have gained the confidence and competence to excel in pitching, designing, coding, and selling products or services effectively in today's competitive landscape.
